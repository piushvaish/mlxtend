    "Resampled paired *t* test procedure (also called k-hold-out paired *t* test) is a popular method for comparing the performance of two models (classifiers or regressors); however, this method has many drawbacks and is not recommended to be used in practice [1], and techniques such as the [`paired_ttest_5x2cv`](paired_ttest_5x2cv.md) should be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain how this method works, let's consider to estimator (e.g., classifiers) A and B. Further, we have a labeled dataset *D*. In the common hold-out method, we typically split the dataset into 2 parts: a training and a test set. In the resampled paired *t* test procedure, we repeat this splitting procedure (with typically 2/3 training data and 1/3 test data) *k* times (usually 30). In each iteration, we train A and B on the training set and evaluate it on the test set. Then, we compute the difference in performance between A and B in each iteration so that we obtain *k* difference measures. Now, by making the assumption that these *k* differences were independently drawn and follow an approximately normal distribution, we can compute the following *t* statistic with *k-1* degrees of freedom according to Student's *t* test, under the null hypothesis that the models A and B have equal performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{\\overline{p} \\sqrt{k}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(p^{(i) - \\overline{p}})^2 / (k-1)}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p^{(i)}$ computes the difference between the model performances in the $i$th iteration, $p^{(i)} = p^{(i)}_A - p^{(i)}_B$, and $\\overline{p}$ represents the average difference between the classifier performances, $\\overline{p} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum^k_{i=1} p^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we computed the *t* statistic we can compute the p value and compare it to our chosen significance level, e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$. If the p value is smaller than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a significant difference in the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. i := 0\n",
    "1. while i < k:\n",
    "  2. split dataset into training and test subsets\n",
    "  3. fit models A and B to the training set\n",
    "  4. compute the performances of A and B on the test set\n",
    "  5. record the performance difference between A and B\n",
    "  6. i := i + 1\n",
    "3. compute t-statistic\n",
    "4. compute p value from t-statistic with k-1 degrees of freedom\n",
    "5. compare p value to chosen significance threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this method, and the reason why it is not recommended to be used in practice, is that it violates the assumptions of Student's *t* test [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the difference between the model performances ($p^{(i)} = p^{(i)}_A - p^{(i)}_B$) are not normal distributed because $p^{(i)}_A$ and $p^{(i)}_B$ are not independent\n",
    "- the $p^{(i)}$'s themselves are not independent because of the overlapping test sets; also, test and training sets overlap as well"
